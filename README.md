# Physics Engine

## More information:

This project is an introduction to 3D collisions and physical interactions. We had approximately one month to develop a simple physics engine using Unity 6000.0.60f, featuring broad- and narrow-phase collision detection as well as realistic physical responses.

### Features:
- Cube, sphere and convex mesh collider
- Dynamic AABB Tree (including tree rotations, broad-phase collision detection, large AABB updates)
- GJK and EPA algorithms for narrow-phase collision detection
- Collision response (basic response and friction)
- Rigid bodies with parameters for bounciness, friction, and damping, including a sleep feature
- Support for both dynamic and kinematic objects
- Handles 150–200 simultaneous collisions
- Simple marble race example
